# Project Overview

Our project focuses on Renovation Project Management, designed to help owners, contractors, and supervisors coordinate 
tasks for both residential and commercial renovations. The system handles key aspects like project details, stakeholder 
roles, resource allocation, and budget tracking. It also includes a review system where owners can provide feedback upon
project completion, enhancing accountability and service improvement.
